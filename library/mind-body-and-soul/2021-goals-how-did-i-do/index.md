My hopes for 2021 were as about as grim as I predicted and once again I did not quite manage to achieve my goals. However, in November, I discovered a possible reason why I struggled so much to reach my goals and in December it was confirmed: I have ADHD. 

<!-- end -->

As a result, I'll give myself a bit of a break here, I actually did manage to achieve one of my goals and I've actually made a ton of headway with another. So I'll call it a win.

## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss... failed

I actually did really well with this for a while but I have struggled to sustain it in a way that I'm happy with. I started to feel a ton of mental pressure in the latter 1/2 of the year - in fact it was this that encouraged me to see my ADHD diagnosis - but that caused me to put aside my weight loss goals and I did so in a big way. I have not gained a significant amount of weight in fact I think I am a little lighter than I was when the year started but only by a few lbs.

## 2) Get my finances in order ... bit of both.

Interestingly, I sort of succeeded here, just not in the way I thought I would. In Feburary I decided I'd have another shot at using [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=MlWYXiFwcokYj2Wo&utm_source=customer_referral) to make myself stick to a budget. I struggled to get my head around it when I first tried it a few years ago but this time it clicked and I've used it religiously ever since. 

We've done a ton of work to the house this year and that's cost a fair bit of money, I also had to buy a new car as my old one broke down, so my credit card debt has only gone down by a few thousand pounds, however I'm now confident that I can stick to my budget and even if I don't pay it off that fast, it will still be gone within a year or two.

## 3) Write more ... failed. Big time.

Writing is something I desperately want to be able to get back into, a friend of mine once told me that if I wanted to be a writer then I'd write and I really took that to heart. However, now I know I have ADHD I'm willing to accept that I'm not to blame for not being able to write as much as I want to. In a few months, I'll be medicated and will hopefully find all of this much easier.

## 4) Launch a software project... success!

So earlier this year, I wrote a few software applications. All of them were apps to help me with organisation, two of them are [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots, one to help me and my wife keep our shopping list in sync and the other is to help me automatically save my receipts to Dropbox. The other app is a Python app (which I've never written in before) which allows me and my wife to catalogue our large library of books and implement a dewey decimal system using [Notion](https://notion.so) as a data store.

The revelation that I have ADHD has reframed my sense of who I am and is still something I am coming to terms with. I've also not yet started medication which may take a few months before I am on the right meds for me. I am still going to write a goals list for the year but I think I will wait a little while before I write it as right now feels a little premature.
